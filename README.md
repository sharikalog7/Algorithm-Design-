## 📁 Files Included

| File Name                   | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| `Fibrecursive.py`          | Calculates Fibonacci numbers recursively. |
| `fibiterativedemo.py`      | Calculates Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach. |
| `Perform T3 sublist Search in Python.py` | Checks if a sublist exists within a list. |
| `minimum difference between any two elements (pair) in given array.py` | Finds the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in an array. |
| `prog2largestclique.py`    | Finds the largest clique in a graph (likely brute-force). |
| `prog3agreedy.py`          | Implements a greedy algorithm related to graph problems. |
| `prog3bheuristic.py`       | Implements a heuristic-based solution (possibly related to clique or graph traversal). |
